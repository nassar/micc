REQUISITE SOFTWARE

To use micc, the following software must already be installed:

Linux
GCC
gputils (GNU PIC Utilities)

INSTALLATION

To install micc:

   make
   make install         # This must be done as root.

To uninstall micc:

   make uninstall       # This must be done as root.

To compile one or more source files into a binary file:

   micc -o program.hex file1.c file2.c ...

This can also be done in two stages, generating assembly language (.s)
from each C source file and then linking them together:

   micc -c file1.c file2.c ...
   micc -o program.hex file1.s file2.s ...

There must be exactly one main() function per final binary file.
